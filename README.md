<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This "The Around U.S" WebApp is the final project of TripleTen Web Development bootcamp.

In this App you can register, login and post photos of U.S.A places that you visited. You can like and dislike a photo of your our other user. If you do not like the photo that you post earlier you can delete it clicking in the trash button on the top right corner of the photo. After you made the registration and login to the page, change your user name and your about field and you can change your avatar picture too.

In this project I had the oportunity to develop my fullstack knowledge learned throughout the course. I have to say that was amazing.

I did not know anything about web development and ending with this project is something very special.

I hope you like it as much a liked to code it.

You can check the project at [https://aroundfull.abacusstar.com.au](https://aroundfull.abacusstar.com.au)
